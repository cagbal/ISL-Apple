Attentively Finding and Moving Among Apples
===================


The code to attentively find the apples in an orchard for more information please refer to our paper[1]. 
----------

The codes are not completely clean(I will do when I have some time). So, one needs to rearrange run.m to run the code, but it is still easy to reproduce the results in the article. 

**Platform**
- only tested in ubuntu 14.04
