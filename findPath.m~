function [ apf_modified ] = findPath( apf, minima )
%findPATH modifies the APF by multiplying it with a 2D Gaussian 
%   2D Gaussian is used to get a clear path between objects with respect
%   to their distance to current fovea. 
% Input: 
% apf : artificial potential function 
% minima : centroids of contours
% Output: 
% modified_apf
